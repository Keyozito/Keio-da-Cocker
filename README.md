**Keio da Cocker** is a Minecraft modpack made for fun, exploration, and chaos—with a strong focus on RPG elements, tech mods, adventuring, and of course... delicious food.
*Originally built to play with friends, this pack is all about having fun, discovering cool stuff, and getting lost in a modded world full of surprises.*

> ⚠️ This pack is still in development! Some items may be uncraftable or feel unbalanced—this is intentional and tied to our custom server lore. If you're playing solo or outside our server, just roll with it (or tweak it yourself)!
